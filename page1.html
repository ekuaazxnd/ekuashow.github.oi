        <p>Soft, gentle, and cute—these qualities unfold as signs, appearing before us.</p>
        <p>Yet they arrive with unease, a quiet descent repeated through unnatural, powerless, and pale acts of copy and paste.</p>

    <div class="block block-3"><p>The shojo (girl) is not concrete.</p><p></p> a replicated digital figure, she extends and multiplies endlessly across online culture and space—filling and overflowing.</p>

    <div class="block block-4"> <p>Her human-like form does not bring her closer to being human,</p><p>nor does it offer space to reflect on the position or potential of human agency.</p><p>Instead, she stands further away—on the side of signs, mutation, and distortion.</p></div>

          <div class="block block-5"> <p>From these signs emerges a form of violence—anxious, powerless—</p><p>spreading with each replication of the girl,</p><p>softening boundaries,</p><p>and unsettling the real.</p>

    <div class="block block-6"> <p>This challenge is not distant.</p><p>It belongs to all of us.</p>
